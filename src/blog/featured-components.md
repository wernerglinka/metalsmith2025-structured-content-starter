        Explore the various section types included in this starter to see the component system in action. The hero section demonstrates how to create compelling page headers with configurable backgrounds, calls to action, and typography options. The content sections show how structured text can be more maintainable than traditional Markdown while still supporting rich formatting when needed.

        Image galleries showcase how media-rich components can be configured entirely through frontmatter, eliminating the need for complex shortcodes or embedded HTML. The testimonial sections illustrate how social proof elements can be standardized across your site while remaining flexible enough to accommodate different presentation needs.

        Call-to-action components demonstrate how conversion-focused elements can be deployed consistently throughout your site with centralized styling and behavior management. The contact sections show how even interactive elements can be integrated into the structured content approach.
