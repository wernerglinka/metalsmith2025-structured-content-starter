        Begin by exploring the existing page configurations to understand how content is organized. Each page's frontmatter tells the complete story of its structure and content, making it easy to understand exactly what appears on the page and why.

        Experiment with rearranging sections within a page or moving sections between different pages. The component system makes these changes straightforward and safe, with no risk of breaking markup or losing formatting.

        Try creating variations of existing components by modifying their configuration properties. Most components support multiple display options and content arrangements, allowing you to create visual variety while maintaining underlying consistency.

        Ready to build your own structured content site? Clone the repository and start by modifying the existing page configurations, then gradually add your own content and customize the component templates to match your design requirements.
