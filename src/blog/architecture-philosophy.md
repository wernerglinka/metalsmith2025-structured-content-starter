        This starter embodies several key principles that make structured content management both powerful and approachable. Each page is composed of independent sections that can be arranged, rearranged, and reused across different contexts. Content is defined declaratively through configuration rather than embedded within template files.
        The component system provides flexibility without complexity. You can create sophisticated page layouts by combining simple, focused components. Each component has a single responsibility and a clear interface, making the entire system easier to understand and maintain.

        True component encapsulation means that each component manages not just its template logic, but also its associated styles and JavaScript behavior. This starter demonstrates how components can be truly self-contained units that include their CSS and JavaScript dependencies, with automatic asset bundling and dependency resolution handled transparently by the build system.

        Unlike traditional CMS approaches that mix content with presentation, this starter maintains strict separation of concerns. Content creators work with structured data. Template authors focus on presentation logic. The build system handles asset management and component dependencies automatically, ensuring that components load in the correct order and their styles don't conflict with each other.
