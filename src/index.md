      title: Rethinking Content Architecture
      titleTag: "h2"
      subTitle: ""
      prose: |-
        Traditional static site generators encourage you to write long-form Markdown content mixed with occasional structured elements. While this works well for blogs and documentation sites, it can become unwieldy when building more complex websites that require consistent design patterns and reusable components.

        This starter takes a different approach by treating content as structured data organized into discrete sections. Instead of writing lengthy Markdown files, you define your content through frontmatter configuration and compose pages from reusable components.
        The benefits of this approach become clear when you consider real-world content management scenarios. Content creators can focus on the substance of their message without worrying about markup details. Designers can ensure visual consistency across the entire site. Developers can maintain a clean separation between content, presentation, and logic.
