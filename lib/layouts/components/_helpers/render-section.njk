{# render-section is a nunjucks macro that uses the name parameter to compose the name of the target component macro.
Since Nunjucks doesn't support dynamic macro names, we have to use a helper function to do this. We also pass the
required meta data through, e.g., site, crumbs, artMuseums, pageFiles, etc. #} {% macro renderSection(section, site,
crumbs, artMuseums, socialLinks, pageFiles, collections) %} {% include "../sections/" + section.sectionType + "/" +
section.sectionType + ".njk" ignore missing %} {% endmacro %}
