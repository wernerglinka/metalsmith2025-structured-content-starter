{# 
  render-section is a nunjucks macro that uses the 'section.sectionType' parameter 
  to compose the name of the target component macro.
  Since Nunjucks doesn't support dynamic macro names, we have to use a helper 
  function to do this. We also pass the required meta data through, e.g., crumbs, 
  data, pageFiles, etc. 
#}

{% macro renderSection(section, crumbs, data, collections, previous, next, urlPath) %}
  {% include "../sections/" + section.sectionType + "/" + section.sectionType + ".njk" ignore missing %}
{% endmacro %}
