  Metalsmith2025 Structured Content Starter
</h1>

This is a component-based, structured content starter built with Metalsmith, demonstrating modern web development patterns without the overhead of JavaScript frameworks. Unlike traditional lonf-text Markdown contents, this starter uses structured content in frontmatter to define reusable page sections and components. Each component manages its own styles and scripts, which are automatically bundled only when used. This approach provides the flexibility of component-driven development while maintaining the simplicity and performance benefits of static site generation with Metalsmith.

## Features

### Component-Based Architecture

- **Structured Content**: Define pages using structured data in frontmatter instead of Markdown body content
- **Reusable Components**: Build pages from modular section components (hero, banner, media, etc.)
- **Component Dependency Bundling**: Automatically bundles only the CSS and JavaScript needed for components used on each page
- **No Framework Overhead**: Get the benefits of component architecture without React, Vue, or other JavaScript frameworks

### Modern Development Patterns

- **Component Manifests**: Each component has a manifest.json defining its dependencies and configuration
- **PostCSS Processing**: Built-in autoprefixing and CSS optimization through the componentDependencyBundler
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components maintain their own styles, scripts, and templates
- **Flexible Section System**: Mix and match different section types to create unique page layouts

### Content Management

- **Frontmatter-Driven**: All page content and structure defined in frontmatter
- **Blog System**: Full-featured blog with pagination, but using structured content approach
- **Section-Based Pages**: Build complex layouts by composing section components
- **Clean URLs**: Permalinks for SEO-friendly URLs

### SEO Features

This starter includes several SEO-friendly features:

- **Sitemap Generation**: A sitemap.xml file is automatically generated in production builds
- **Robots.txt**: A robots.txt file is included and processed with Nunjucks
- **404 Page**: A custom 404 error page that works with Netlify and other hosting providers
- **SEO Metadata**: Each page can include custom title, description, and social image metadata

### Component Dependency Bundler

The `componentDependencyBundler` plugin is a key differentiator of this starter:

- **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: Scans your pages to identify which components are used
- **Smart Bundling**: Creates optimized CSS and JavaScript bundles containing only the code for components actually used
- **PostCSS Processing**: Applies autoprefixing and minification to component styles
- **Performance Optimized**: Reduces payload by excluding unused component code
- **Component Isolation**: Each component's styles and scripts are scoped and managed independently

### Development Experience

- **Live Reloading**: Development server with automatic browser refresh
- **Code Quality Tools**: ESLint and Prettier integration for consistent code style
- **Optimized Build**: HTML minification for production builds
- **Combined Scripts**: Run `npm run fix` to format and lint your code in one command

## Quick start

To get started with this Metalsmith starter You should have Node.js version 18 or higher installed.

1.  **Create a Metalsmith site.**

    Clone the starter repository to create a new blog.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-structured-content-starter my-site
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-site/
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

    Open the `src` directory in your code editor of choice and edit any page's frontmatter to modify its sections. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **Available scripts**

    This starter includes several useful scripts:

    ```shell
    npm start      # Start development server with live reloading
    npm run dev    # Run a development build
    npm run build  # Create a production build
    npm run serve  # Serve the build directory with Browser-Sync
    npm run format # Format code with Prettier

## How Structured Content Works

This starter takes a different approach from traditional Markdown-based static sites:

### Content Definition

Pages are defined using structured data in frontmatter rather than Markdown content. For example:

```yaml
sections:
  - sectionType: hero
    text:
      title: 'Welcome to My Site'
      prose: 'This content is defined in structured data'
    containerFields:
      background:
        image: '/assets/images/hero.jpg'
  - sectionType: banner
    text:
      title: 'Another Section'
      prose: 'Each section is a reusable component'
```

### Component System

- **Section Components**: Large page sections like hero, banner, media blocks
- **Partial Components**: Smaller reusable elements like buttons, cards, navigation
- **Template Helpers**: Utilities for rendering sections and building attributes

### Automatic Asset Management

The `componentDependencyBundler` automatically:

1. Scans your pages to identify which components are used
2. Bundles only the CSS and JavaScript for those components
3. Applies PostCSS processing (autoprefixing, minification)
4. Outputs optimized per-page stylesheets and scripts

## Content Validation

This starter includes built-in validation to catch common configuration errors:

- **Type validation**: Ensures booleans are actual booleans (not strings like `"false"`)
- **Enum validation**: Validates values like `titleTag` (h1-h6) and `buttonStyle` (primary, secondary, ghost)
- **Component validation**: Ensures referenced section types exist

See [Content Validation Guide](docs/VALIDATION.md) for complete details.

## Deploy

Deploy and Host on any static hosting service. For example [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Here is an article about [how to deploy Metalsmith on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/12/08/a-step-by-step-guide-metalsmith-on-netlify/). The process is similar for this Metalsmith2025 Structured Content Starter.

## Development

### Template Formatting
Some Nunjucks templates use dynamic HTML tags (e.g., user-configurable header levels) which are excluded from Prettier formatting due to parser limitations. See `.prettierignore` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for specific files and details.

### Running the Project
- `npm start` - Start development server with watch mode
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
